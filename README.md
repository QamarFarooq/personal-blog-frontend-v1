# Matrix Theme Design React App

I created this app to understand fully all the frontend and backend of web development, along with all the 
how user authentication, content creation etc work and how it all fit together. This website uses the 
personal-blog-backend-v1 project repo. I use mongoDb and node.js for the backend and react for the front end.
The matrix rain effect was really hard to pull of, but I got it to work in the end.
