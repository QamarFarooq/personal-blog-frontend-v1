# MERN (MongoDb Express, React, Node.js) stack Matrix themed website

I created this app to understand fully all the frontend and backend of web development, along with all the 
how user authentication, basic pagination, content creation etc work and how it all fits together. This website uses the 
personal-blog-backend-v1 project repo for the backend with mongoDb express and node.js, and react for the front end.
The matrix rain effect was really hard to pull of, but I got it to work in the end.
